this is a practice document.

## What is a branch?

A branch is a ref(erence) to a commit. When HEAD points to a branch, we say we are 'on' that branch.
When we make a commit while on a branch, the branch is updated to ref(er) to the new commit.


## What is HEAD?

HEAD is a ref(erence) to the current working branch or commit.




Now working on learning git merge!
- git merge: Merge changes from different branches

## Merging
Merging means to bring the changes from one branch to another.

- A fast-forward merge happens when the target branch was branched from the current one, and there are
no new changes to the current branch since then.
